# AeroDB

## Overview
AeroDB is a desktop application designed to manage and manipulate a Bill of Materials (BOM) database within a hypothetical aerospace structures manufacturing company. This application facilitates various user roles with tailored access to view and edit part information, assembly details, work orders, and inventory data.

## Motivation
The inception of AeroDB was inspired by outdated software I encountered at a previous employer. Confronted with its limitations and user-unfriendliness, I decided to create AeroDB to refine my software development skills and provide a modern alternative that addresses these pain points.

## Features
AeroDB boasts a user-friendly interface that caters to different user roles with specific permissions:
- **Engineer:** Authorized to modify parts, assemblies, and work orders.
- **Materials:** Can edit work orders and inventory records.
- **Shop Floor:** Has view-only access, with no edit permissions.
